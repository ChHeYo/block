# Blockchain

This is a mini-sized blockchain.
Block takes JSON object that contains transaction data and hashes data within itself
Miners can mine that block but depending on the difficulty setting, their mining process might take 1~10 minutes.
Unlike Python version, Java version has no Merkle root for the sake of simplicity.
