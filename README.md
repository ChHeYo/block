# Blockchain

This is a mini-sized blockchain. <br/>
Block takes JSON object that contains transaction data and hashes data within itself. <br/>
Miners can mine that block but depending on the difficulty setting, their mining process might take 1~10 minutes. <br/>
Unlike Python version, Java version has no Merkle root for the sake of simplicity. <br/>
